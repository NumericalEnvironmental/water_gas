# water_gas
This python script uses the numerical method-of-lines to model gas injection into a one-dimensional system of variable geometry with a mobile, albeit unsaturated, water phase.

The following tab-delimited input files are required:

* ICs.txt - initial conditions
* grid.txt - spatial discretization
* mat_list.txt - material distribution within column
* materials.txt - physical properties of porous media
* sources.txt - source/sink terms
* times.txt - output times
